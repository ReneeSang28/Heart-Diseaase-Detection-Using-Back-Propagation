# Heart Disease Prediction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting heart disease using machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes key medical parameters that help identify the risk of heart disease. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **Heartdisease.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualization, and model-building steps.
- **README.md** – Documentation for the project.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning model training
- Other libraries as required
- Dataset used - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Heartdisease.ipynb
   ```

## Results & Insights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides insights into the dataset.
- Machine learning models are trained to predict heart disease risk.
- Model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are analyzed.
